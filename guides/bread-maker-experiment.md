Did you know that almost all comerical bread uses emulsifiers, and the major source of emulsifiers in people's diets is bread? Did you also know that emulsifiers can cause gut dysfunction?  And wheat often is contaminated with pesticies such as glyphosate?   If you eat a lot of bread, then making your own bread for a few weeks with high quality wheat flour could solve a lot of your problems!  You might not actually have a gluten issue.   If you've been diagnosed with celiac disease by a doctor and had a positive gluten antibody blood test, you should not do this experiment.

Try with these kinds of flour:
- Organic glyphosphate free wheat flour
- Flour shipped from the UK
- Flour shipped from Italy
