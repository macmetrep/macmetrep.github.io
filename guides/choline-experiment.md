## Overview
A 4-day protocol to test your body's response to increased choline intake through egg yolk consumption.

Ideally, we would have looked at your DNA and told you exactly what your daily choline requirement is, but we can use this experiment as a binary test to see whether you're getting enough to feel optimal. 

## Protocol Details
### Daily Requirements
- The core goal of this experiment is to try to eat nine egg yolks or whole eggs every day for four straight days.
- You can poach them, you can boil them, you can fry them, you can scramble them - it makes no difference!
- Before you start and then at the end of the last day of the experiment, we need you to track how you feel (questions below).
- Write down your scores before you start, and then test again at the end of day 4.

## Implementation
### Preparation
- Source high-quality eggs
  For this experiment, you really don't want to be using the cheapest eggs possible. You want to ideally find pasture-raised eggs. Costco or Sam's Club have the most affordable and also the highest quality pasture-raised eggs that we've reliably found.
- Plan meals incorporating eggs
  You don't need to eat nine whole eggs alone every single day. It's a lot easier if you incorporate them in meals, in sauces, in omelets, and in different things that you can bake.
- Prepare tracking method
  The idea that you might not be able to track whether you've eaten 9 eggs in a single day for 4 days straight. It may be silly to you, but in the grand scheme of things, life can be crazy. Make sure you find a way to track this whether it's an Excel spreadsheet or a habit tracking app on your phone.

### Daily Schedule
You can eat the eggs in whatever fashion you want, but we typically find it's easier to spread them out across the day. 
#### Morning
- 3 eggs with breakfast
#### Midday
- 3 eggs with lunch
#### Evening
- 3 eggs with dinner

## Tracking Points
- Energy levels: How much time during the past 4 days did you have a lot of energy?
  (1 - All of the time), (2 - Most of the time), (3 - Some of the time),  (4 - A little of the time), (5 - None of the time)
- Mental focus: How much time during the past 4 days did you have a trouble concentrating or focussing?
  (1 - All of the time), (2 - Most of the time), (3 - Some of the time),  (4 - A little of the time), (5 - None of the time)
- Physical performance: How much time during the past 4 days did you feel sluggish or drained?
  (1 - All of the time), (2 - Most of the time), (3 - Some of the time),  (4 - A little of the time), (5 - None of the time)
- Sleep quality: How much time during the past 4 days did you feel refreshed upon waking?
  (1 - All of the time), (2 - Most of the time), (3 - Some of the time),  (4 - A little of the time), (5 - None of the time)
- Digestive response: How many times during the past 4 days did you feel like your bowel movements were easy, healthy and peaceful?
  (1 - All of the time), (2 - Most of the time), (3 - Some of the time),  (4 - A little of the time), (5 - None of the time)

## Safety Notes
- The immediate response to saying "eat 9 eggs a day" is usually, "what about cholesterol?". There are three things to note here:
  9 eggs a day is not that much saturated fat
  Dietary cholesterol should not effect serum cholesterol unless you are deficient
  4 days is nothing on the grand scheme of things. If the experiment works and shows that you need more choline. You can get it through supplementation without eggs.
- Stay hydrated
  Many say that eggs are nature's multivitamin, and with this experiment, you will be rapidly increasing a good amount of different nutrients in your body. It makes sense to stay hydrated because any excess vitamins will come out in your sweat.
- Balance with vegetables
  The second response to the idea that someone needs to eat 9 eggs is usually an overwhelming struggle to see themselves physically consuming 9 eggs which they don't love. In our experience, if you eat the eggs with a bunch of vegetables (either in an omelettw, when they're poached, or when they're scrambled), it's a lot easier to do.
