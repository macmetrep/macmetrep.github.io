This diet is the [High Starch Diet](../diets/high-starch-diet.html) with a few modifications.  Please read it first and then come back here.

Essentially, as someone who is more fit or active, you want to expand the amount of protein you consume.  This is because as people become more lean, they actually require more protein to prevent their bodies from breaking down muscle tissue as they lose weight, unlike more overweight people who preserve their muscle tissue quite well as they lose fat even when they are not eating a lot of protein.

Some others work out a lot even if they are overweight, and thus need more protein to help repair their muscles from their workouts.  Since they are working out and are creating a higher demand for protein, they still somewhat create the low protein environment that make these diets work even with their higher protein intake.

If you are strength training, then you want to hit a target of 0.7g/lbs of body weight for protein.  If you are only endurance training, then you want to hit a target of 0.5g/lbs of body weight.  Use lean protein sources like chicken, turkey, fish, and egg whites.   If you eat seafood, try only eating cod, salmon, herring, anchovies, shrimp, scallops, oysters, clams, and sardines.

Basically make sure you hit your protein target, make sure you hit your micronutrients with other foods and fill the rest with starchy carbs and vegetables.
