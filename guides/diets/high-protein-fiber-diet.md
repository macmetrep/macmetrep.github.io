## Overview
A diet focused on protein and fiber-rich foods to improve satiety and support sustainable weight loss.

Fundamentally, there are a couple of things that come together for us to recommend that you do this diet.
- You seem to get energy from protein.
- You're athletic and have higher protein needs due to protein oxidation.
- Protein and vegetables give you high satiety. 

## Key Principles
- Try to hit a high protein intake (1.6-2.2g per kg or 0.7g-1g per lb of body weight) every day
- Also try to hit a high fiber intake (25-35g) per day
- Eat balanced meals with a mixture of fats and carbohydrates.
- Focus on whole food sources for all your nutrition. If you're eating protein shakes or taking supplemental fiber, then this really isn't going to work. 

## Recommended Foods
### Protein Sources
- Lean meats

  Chicken, turkey, bison, elk, venison, and even some kinds of beef will work here. 
- Seafood
  
  If you opt to go fish heavy, try and limit your fatty fish or big fish intake to only two or three meals per week. Focus on small fish that won't accumulate heavy metals.  Sardines, herring, mackerel, salmon and anchovies are great options.
- Eggs

  If you have easy, affordable access to pasture-raised eggs, always prioritize those over any other kind of eggs. Costco and Sam's Club can be a lifesaver here.
- Greek yogurt

  Just to get your macros balanced out, you're really going to want to go for the low and no-fat version of Greek yogurt. Watch out for added sugars, which are slipped in to make up for a flavor profile. 
- Legumes

  Unprocessed plant sources of protein will always come with additional carbohydrates as found in nature, so make sure you're not getting all of your protein from here. Sources include edamame & beans. 
- Tofu and tempeh

### Fiber Sources
- Vegetables (especially leafy greens) & vegetable looking fruits

  Make sure you clean and cook your veg thoroughly to reduce naturally occuring toxins, and denature lectins & oxalates. Great options are Collard greens, Kale, Spinach, Brussels sprouts, Broccoli, Cauliflower and Okra.
  
- Legumes

  Any kind of cooked bean or pea will suffice here. Make sure they are properly cooked. If you are cooking the beans yourself, they are safest when pressure cooked.
- Seeds

  Chia, Flax and Pumpkin seeds are high in fiber and thus also have a great fiber to everything else ratio. Whilst these shouldn't make up the bulk of your fiber source, they can be a great topping or addition to make meals interesting.
- Berries

  Berries, whilst sweet, are actually relatively low in sugar and high in fiber. Blueberries, Stawberries, Blackberries and Raspberries are great berries to add to your cookbook. Make sure you wash them thoroughly. To save time & money, frozen berries are often a great option.
- Nuts

  Almonds, Pistachios, Hazelnuts, Peanuts, Pecans and Macadamias are all great sources of fiber in nuts. Ideally we'd shoot for macadamias due to its fat composition, but really, again you don't want the bulk of your fiber coming from nuts, so shouldn't be an issue. These are nice to spruce up your plate and keep you sane, but you don't want to overdo it. 

## Meal Planning
- Include protein at every meal

  To be high protein, you need to be consuming protein at every meal. For this to be feasible, it makes the most sense to prep several batches of 4-8 ounces of protein the weekend before a week starts.
  
- Add fiber-rich foods to each meal

  Every time you sit down to have a meal full of protein, you also want to be adding some of the fiber source or vegetables too. Whilst this dietary protocol is slightly binary, it actually makes eating very simple. You have meal prepped protein sources and you have meal prepped vegetable sources. Every time you need a meal, you just grab one of each.
  
- Pre-plan snacks

  If you typically struggle with adherence to changes in your diet, then it may make sense to pre-plan having snacks around that are either vegetables, full of fiber, or high protein snacks like jerky. If overall adherence to the diet is really hard, then it might be a sign that this diet isn't a good fit for you. We see in the data that snacking is usually where people proverbially "fall off the wagon". When hunger hits at an odd time, and you are used to reaching for something that is not part of this protocol, it's very hard to mentally override what is a subconscious directive. 

## Tips for Success
- Start slowly with fiber

  For many, the volume of fiber that we are prescribing will be astronomical to what you are used to, and so it makes sense to start with a very small amount and see how your stomach reacts. The great news is that if your stomach reacts poorly, it's usually because your microbiome isn't ready to consume that amount of fiber, but it will respond by growing, and so very quickly you'll be able to tolerate increasing amounts of fiber. If your fiber intolerance symptoms persist, just ramp down the volume again for a small while. 

   
- Drink plenty of water

  If you're not used to this amount of protein, it can be temporarily hard on your kidneys and also difficult to digest. We highly encourage drinking plenty of water which will both keep your digestion flowing and your kidneys healthy.
  
- Time protein intake around workouts

  If you're doing resistance training or a material endurance training volume as well, make sure that you're eating protein close to those training sessions.
