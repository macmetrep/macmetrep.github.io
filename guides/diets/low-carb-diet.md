## Overview
A diet focused on reducing carbohydrate intake while maintaining adequate protein and healthy fats for optimal weight management.

For many people, the default state is actually that they only need carbohydrate intake to perform athletic feats and that their body would rather use fats for fuel for the majority of the day. That's what we're encompassing here.

This usually also shows up that carbohydrates dysregulate someone's blood sugar and make them hungry and drive them to eat more. 

## Key Principles
- Carbs limited to 50-100g per day

  It's in the name low-carb, we want to limit your carbohydrates to between 50 and 100 grams a day. And even then, these carbohydrates probably want to come in the form of fruit or naturally found in vegetables.
  
- Adequate protein intake

  What can differentiate a low-carb diet from a full ketogenic diet is actually that you can eat a bit more protein on a low-carb diet than a ketogenic diet. You don't need to be hitting one gram of protein per pound of body weight. You can probably cap it at about 0.7 grams.
  
- Higher healthy fat intake

  If you're switching from a high carb low fat diet then you'll want to actually increase your fat intake here. The focus is on monounsaturated fats and saturated fats.
  
- Emphasis on whole foods

  This means that the meals on your plate will primarily not have a starchy or carbohydrate base. So, rice, pasta, bread are all left behind. And usually a portion of meat or a fatty fruit and vegetable like avocado becomes the base. Most carbohydrate sources are refined, so this actually should let you get back to eating a primarily whole food diet. 

## Recommended Foods
### Primary Foods
- Meats and poultry
  
  Beef, lamb, chicken, turkey - have at it. When it comes to chicken and turkey, it probably still makes sense to try and shoot for breast and to skip eating the skin, and then make up the fats in other places. As it's not a full ketogenic diet and you don't want to go overboard on the fat, you probably want to pick New York strips for ribeyes if your having steak.
  
- Fish and seafood

  Seafood is absolutely welcome. If you want to eat fish regularly, try and limit your intake of large fish like tuna to only twice a week, and then make up the rest with small fish like mackerel or sardines. This will limit your heavy metal exposure. If you really want to indulge, obviously you can add crab or lobster. Shrimp is actually pretty affordable if you buy it frozen. And one of the healthiest items as seafood you can have is scallops. Again, be mindful of your heavy metal exposure so you don't want to be eating seafood every day.

- Eggs

  We love eggs on a keto diet. There is a 50/50 protein to fat ratio by grams which means that it's about a 3:1 ratio of fat to protein calories. If you're going to make eggs a staple of your diet, make sure you're getting the highest quality eggs possible. Pasture A's is the gold standard. Costco and Sam's Club will make your life a lot easier here.

- Non-starchy vegetables

  This is funny to call out, but most people don't realize that many of the vegetables they eat are full of carbohydrates. As we're limiting carbohydrates, we want to focus on the low-carb veggies. Those are typically the leafy green and cruciferous veggies, like broccoli or spinach. There's some developing science around raw veggies, so if you're going to make vegetables a large part of your meal, make sure that they are thoroughly cleaned and cooked.
  
- Nuts and seeds

  Nuts and seeds have a great protein-to-fat ratio and can be added to keep things interesting. But do not go eating tablespoons of peanut butter. Nuts are high in polyunsaturated fats, and so we don't want to make them a keystone piece of the diet.
  
- Healthy oils

  Critically, by calling out healthy fats, we want to draw attention to the fact that there are unhealthy oils. You don't want any industrial fats. So no seed oils. Avocado oil is technically a fruit oil, and you can fry and saut√© with it, but you don't want to be adding it as a salad dressing or eating anything that is deep-fried in it.
  
- Limited dairy

  Full-fat dairy, like half-and-half or whipping cream, are great. The tricky thing with dairy is that it actually comes with a lot of carbohydrates. You can find dairy products where they've removed the lactose and the sugar which can be used sparingly 'cause bear in mind they are some kind of process food. 

### Allowed Carb Sources
- Low-sugar fruits (berries)

  Berries, whilst sweet, are actually relatively low in sugar and high in fiber. Blueberries, Stawberries, Blackberries and Raspberries are great berries to add to your cookbook. Make sure you wash them thoroughly. To save time & money, frozen berries are often a great option.
  
- Leafy greens and Above-ground vegetables

  Make sure you clean and cook your vegetables thoroughly to reduce naturally occuring toxins, and denature lectins & oxalates. Great options are Collard greens, Kale, Spinach, Brussels sprouts, Broccoli, Cauliflower and Okra.
  
- Small portions of legumes

  Any kind of cooked bean or pea will suffice here. Make sure they are properly cooked. If you are cooking the beans yourself, they are safest when pressure cooked. Legumes naturally come with starch, so be mindful of the carb count. 

## Meal Planning
### Daily Macros
- Carbs: 50-100g

  This is the most critical part of this regimen. You need to limit your carbohydrates to no more than 100 grams per day. That will mean that you should not be eating and pure carb sources like bread. If you try and sneak in pieces of bread, pasta, rice, and argue that it will fit your macros, it will make it a lot harder for you to stick to your diet with your carbohydrate cravings.
   
- Protein: 1.2-1.6g/kg body weight

  Try to hit a protein intake (1.2-1.6g per kg or 0.5g-0.7g per lb of body weight) every day. You are not going to waste away at this level, Patchwork has articles on this. For many, this actually might be even more protein than you're used to eating. And trust us, you will get used to it. 
  
- Fat: Remainder of calories

  The goal here is to limit carbohydrates, not hit a certain amount of fat. Just let fat make up the remainder of your day. You don't have to go out of your way to add fat to everything. 

## Tips for Success
- Track carbs carefully

  You can start with OCD level tracking at the beginning and once you get used to it, you can taper off. I think what you'll find is that there are actually more carbohydrates and a lot of the things you eat than you realized. You don't need to go out of your way to add any fat sources here, but critically for this regimen to work, you do need to track the carbohydrate intake. 
   
- Stay hydrated

  In the process of your body dumping salt, you'll also be peeing more, so you want to make sure you stay hydrated.
  
- Include electrolytes

  When you go on a low carb diet, what you are effectively trying to do is keep your insulin radically low. Insulin, the primary fat storage hormone, also helps your body regulate its salt balance. So by having insulin low, your body will be dumping salt on a regular basis. You need to increase your salt intake to make up for it. The Keto flu described below is primarily driven by people being low on salt.

  Many people choose to supplement with magnesium, potassium, and sodium electrolytes through different forms and that can usually help you if your body is really letting go of a lot of salt.
  
- Plan meals ahead

  Planning meals ahead and doing meal prep will absolutely prevent you from finding yourself in a hungry state where you make a bad decision or you're vulnerable to a bad decision.
  
- Watch for hidden carbs

  As mentioned above, you probably don't even realize there's carbohydrates in all sorts of stuff that you already eat, like milk. The first couple of weeks can take some getting used to as you discover there's added sugar or added carbs to almost everything, including stuff like ketchup.
