Congrats, we have figured out your macronutrient of choice!  Now we can expand the diet further to make sure you get enough micronutrients in the long term as you lose weight using starch.  We basically want to add foods to make the diet balanced, while keeping as much of your calories coming from potatoes.    

One example addition set is, along with their micronutrients:

1. 🥚 3 eggs, poached in the microwave with runny yolks to have more nutrition from runny vs. hard yolks. (choline and many other micronutrients, 250 cal)
2. 🫐 100-120g of frozen acai berry and a optional 10-15g of honey or maple syrup for taste (vitamin E + minerals and others) (120 cal)
3. 🥕 1 large carrot (vitamin A, 50 cal)
4. 🍙 Plain nori seaweed sheets (for iodine + flavor) (2 cal)
5. 💊 Supplements: Methylfolate, Zinc (25mg), selenium (100mg), and a vitamin K MK-7 supplement.  Vitamin D is another supplement, but you also can get that from sun exposure. 
6. (Optionally) 🍫 20g of 80% dark chocolate as a treat

If any of the above foods do not agree with you, or are not easily available, you can use an app like [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/) to calculate what would cover your micronutritional needs, or potentially subsitute it with a supplement.  Make sure to track all of the food you eat in a day, including the potatoes to know how much micronutrition you need. 

If you want help doing this, please feel free to contact us!
