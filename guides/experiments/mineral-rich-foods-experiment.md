## Overview
The goal of this experiment is to see if giving you a diet rich in minerals will make you feel better.  If this experiment makes you feel more energetic or alive, or solves some other issue, then this suggests you need more minerals than the average person or had a mineral deficiency somewhere in your diet.  4 days should be enough to see if it works, but you can extend it to one week if you want. 

During this experiment, you should stay hydrated since you are eating a lot more minerals than normal.  Depending on your diet, you may be eating more than you need, and water / hydration is how your body will keep you balance for the most part.

## Food Based Experiment

Usually it's better to get nutrients from food directly vs. supplements, so here is a version of the experiment that uses food.

- Oysters, 4.  Gives Copper, Selenium & Zinc
- Frozen Acai, 100g. Gives Manganese
- Seaweed Nori Sheets or other seaweeds. Gives Iodine.  
    * Feel free to crumble them up and sprinkle them on top of your food as a spice
- Brazil Nuts, 1-2.  Gives Selenium
    - Pork Kidney, 2 oz is a an alternative for Selenium.
- Spinnach or Swiss Chard, 1 to 2 cups, gives Magnesium 
- Potatoes, 1 lb, gives Potassium
- Beef Liver, 1 oz, gives Copper , eat separately from the oysters by a few hours
- Sodium & Potassium: Lite Salt (50% sodium, 50% potassium), apply liberally to taste

## Alternative Supplement Based Experiment

If any of the above foods doesn't work for you, then you can try these alternatives for the specific nutrient.  For any supplement you take, eat it with food.  You can choose to do this all with supplements or a combination of supplements and food.

* Magnesium Glycinate Supplement, 400mg
* Zinc Picolate Supplement, 25mg, seperated by at least 4 hours from the copper supplement since they contest each other for absorption.  
* Copper Supplement, 2mcg daily , seperated by at least 4 hours from the zinc supplement or food.
* Selenium Supplement, 100mcg 
* Iodine Supplement, 250mcg
* Manganese Supplement, 8mg
* Sodium & Potassium: Lite Salt (50% sodium, 50% potassium), apply liberally to taste

## Tracking Points

While you do the experiment, you should track these 5 things and how much of a change it was from your baseline, plus any other unique changes you notice.  If you've noticed major positive changes, then that is an indicator you need more minerals in general.
