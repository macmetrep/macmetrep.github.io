Did you know that blue and green spectrum light are signals that our body use to determine it is day time?   Before electric lighting was invented, humans did not have a source of blue and green spectrum light (confirm with candles).  Nowadays with our screens and night time lights, we have lights that contain blue and green spetrum lighting until we go to sleep.  This can cause our body to think it is still day time on some level and can cause issues with our sleep.

Reducing the blue and green spectrum light in your home can help you sleep better.
