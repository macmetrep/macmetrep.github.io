title: Omega-3 Foods Experiment

## Overview
This protocol is being recommended to you either because we've seen high inflammatory markers or some interesting lipid metabolism issues.

It's a 4-day protocol to test your body's response to increased omega-3 rich fish consumption and address potential omega-3 deficiencies.

For many framing this as an 'experiment', is right on track. Only about 20% of adults consume seafood at twice a week in America, and we're recommending, for a short period, you up that.

Whilst we're seeking the omega-3s for the point of this experiment, we do not advise taking any omega-3 supplements. Omega-3 fatty acids themselves are extremely vulnerable to oxidation and peroxidation. It's actually why the American food industry removes omega-3 from foods so that they can last longer on shelves. That means that cod liver oil or krill oil that you get on Amazon is likely rancid/highly vulnerable to breakdown.

We want to prioritize getting omega-3s from whole food sources. 

## Protocol Details
### Recommended Fish Sources
When it comes to fish, they're not all equal. Some fish are dramatically higher in omega-3s. We also want to try and eat fish that are as close as possible to the bottom of the food chain, such that they won't have accumulated heavy metals.

These are the go to fish we recommend
- Wild-caught salmon (Alaskan is best)
- Mackerel
- Sardines
- Herring
- Anchovies

If you're eating fish from a can, make sure that the fish comes in either salt water or olive oil. You don't want anything in soybean oil, sunflower oil, or other seed oils etc. 

## Daily Requirements
- 2-3 grams of omega-3s each day

  Think of it like a supplement, so you don't need to base your entire dietary plan around eating fish. We just want to make sure you're eating two to three servings. If I make a three-fish on the side, during the day.

- Minimal processing/cooking

  We don't want to deep fry the fish or overcook the omega-3s and make them go rancid. Poaching is great for salmon, you can usually eat the other fish straight out of a can.
  
- Track responses

  Later on in the guide is a comprehensive way to track how you're feeling. You want to make sure you take these measures before you start the experiment and then also after the experiment. 

  

### Meal Suggestions
#### Breakfast
- Smoked salmon with eggs
- Sardines on toast
- Mackerel pate

#### Lunch/Dinner
- Grilled salmon
- Herring fillets
- Fish soup/stew

#### Other examples of what two to three grams of omega-3s look like
- A 6-ounce portion of mackerel contains over 2g of omega-3s
- A 4-ounce portion of of wild-caught salmon contains over 3g of omega-3s
- A 3-ounce portion of of sardines contains about 2g of omega-3s
- A 3-ounce portion of herring contains about 1.7-2g of omega-3s
- A 3-ounce portion of anchovies contains about 2g of omega-3s

## Tracking Points
- Energy levels:

  How much time during the past 4 days did you have a lot of energy? (1 - All of the time), (2 - Most of the time), (3 - Some of the time), (4 - A little of the time), (5 - None of the time)

- Mental focus:

  How much time during the past 4 days did you have a trouble concentrating or focussing? (1 - All of the time), (2 - Most of the time), (3 - Some of the time), (4 - A little of the time), (5 - None of the time)
- Physical performance:

  How much time during the past 4 days did you feel sluggish or drained? (1 - All of the time), (2 - Most of the time), (3 - Some of the time), (4 - A little of the time), (5 - None of the time)
- Sleep quality:
  How much time during the past 4 days did you feel refreshed upon waking? (1 - All of the time), (2 - Most of the time), (3 - Some of the time), (4 - A little of the time), (5 - None of the time)
- Digestive response:
  How many times during the past 4 days did you feel like your bowel movements were easy, healthy and peaceful? (1 - All of the time), (2 - Most of the time), (3 - Some of the time), (4 - A little of the time), (5 - None of the time)

## Implementation Tips
- Source high-quality fish

  Costco or Sam's Club will go a long way in getting you very affordable Alaskan salmon. Your local grocery store will do the can stuff pretty good.
  
- Vary preparation methods

  Fish on fish on fish can get a little boring. So try and bury how you prep or cook the meals.
  
- Consider frozen options

  Frozen seafood makes it extremely affordable and in many ways actually keeps it fresher and cleaner than fridge-bought.
  
- Balance with vegetables

  Make sure you are eating steamed or cooked vegetables alongside your meals of seafood, eating a bunch of oily fish with nothing else can cause GI distress.
  
- Avoid deep frying

  Deep frying the fish itself will mess up the omega-3 oxidation, but also it's basically impossible to get fish fried in tallow like it traditionally was in fish & chips. So avoid deep frying any of this food.
