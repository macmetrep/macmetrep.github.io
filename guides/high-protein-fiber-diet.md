## Overview
A diet focused on protein and fiber-rich foods to improve satiety and support sustainable weight loss.

Fundamentally, there are a couple of things that come together for us to recommend that you do this diet.
- You seem to get energy from protein.
- You're athletic and have higher protein needs due to protein oxidation.
- Protein and vegetables give you high satiety. 

## Key Principles
- Try to hit a high protein intake (1.6-2.2g per kg or 0.7g-1g per lb of body weight) every day
- Also try to hit a high fiber intake (25-35g) per day
- Eat balanced meals with a mixture of fats and carbohydrates.
- Focus on whole food sources for all your nutrition. If you're eating protein shakes or taking supplemental fiber, then this really isn't going to work. 

## Recommended Foods
### Protein Sources
- Lean meats

  Chicken, turkey, bison, elk, venison, and even some kinds of beef will work here. 
- Seafood
  
  If you opt to go fish heavy, try and limit your fatty fish or big fish intake to only two or three meals per week. Focus on small fish that won't accumulate heavy metals. 
- Eggs

  If you have easy, affordable access to pasture-raised eggs, always prioritize those over any other kind of eggs. Costco and Sam's Club can be a lifesaver here.
- Greek yogurt

  Just to get your macros balanced out, you're really going to want to go for the low and no-fat version of Greek yogurt. Watch out for added sugars, which are slipped in to make up for a flavor profile. 
- Legumes

  Unprocessed plant sources of protein will always come with additional carbohydrates as found in nature, so make sure you're not getting all of your protein from here. Sources include edamame & beans. 
- Tofu and tempeh

### Fiber Sources
- Vegetables (especially leafy greens)
- Legumes
- Seeds (chia, flax)
- Berries
- Nuts

## Meal Planning
- Include protein at every meal
- Add fiber-rich foods to each meal
- Aim for 4-6 smaller meals
- Pre-plan snacks

## Tips for Success
- Start slowly with fiber increase
- Drink plenty of water
- Time protein intake around workouts
- Consider a food diary
