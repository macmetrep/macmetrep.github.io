## Experiment Rationale

One core principle of the Patchwork System is matching your diet to what works best for your body.  One major part of this is which foods do you extract the most energy from in a usable form for the rest of your body.  Based on your current answers, we have determined that your body most likely works best with starch as a primary source of energy in it's current state.

You have also said you want something that is a bit more flexible and fits with your lifestyle, so we have created this diet for you to help you achieve your goals in the way you want.  If you want to get results more quickly or if your are not sure this is working properly, you can try the [Potato Diet Experiment](potato-experiment.hml) instead or later on.

## TODO COMPLETE

Fill it out, mostly a combo of starch solution and mostly potato?
