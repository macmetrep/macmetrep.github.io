## The Problem
* Many people have a hard time losing weight.  The standard experience of weight loss is pretty shitty.  Low energy, bad mood and a lot of extra work.
* Weight loss does not have to be shitty like this.  It can be as easy and unoticiable as going on vacation to Asia or Europe, where people lose weight without noticing it and eat whatever they feel like.

## The Reason
* People have a hard time losing weight because there is a set of reasons that block them from losing weight easily.  Each person's patchwork of reasons are unique to them.
* This is why their friend might've lost weight easily on a ketogenic diet, but when they try themselves do not lose weight on it easily, or feel really bad when they do.
* It is also why the USA is fatter than Japan.  The amount of things that can cause weight issues in the USA is greater than the amount of things that cause weight issues in Japan, by a significant degree.  This increases the chance that a person's unique set of weight loss blockers match their environment, increasing their weight.
* Determining what these blockers are is not easy, and many are not known by the general public.

## The Solution
* Patchwork solves this by determining what a person's weight loss blockers are, and then gives targeted advice on how to solve these blockers for the least hassle. 
* We do this by gathering information about a person via:
	* Questions about how their body responds to certain things
	* Experiments to determine how their body works, such as eating a specific diet or taking a specific supplement
* Optionally, we can make the process faster via:
	* DNA Analysis
	* Lab Testing
* As your body changes, how to progress further often also changes.  What might've worked when you were overweight, doesn't work when you have an average weight and requires modifications if you want to get abs.

## Case Study

Mahyar, a founder of Patchwork, had a very hard time losing weight.  He tried many things, but nothing could stick.  He was overweight as long as he could remember and always had to watch what he ate or would start gaining weight quickly. 

Frustrated with this, he researched many different diets and potential reasons why he might have a hard time with weight loss.  After a lot of research and experimenting, he determined that a very high starch diet worked best with his body, which goes against common advice given for weight loss.

Mahyar then went on a "mostly potato" diet and lost 25lbs of fat with no muscle loss.  The experience was very easy, unlike many other diets he tried.  His energy levels went up on the diet and he had little to no cravings.  It was very much like ozempic, but without side effects.  He tried the keto diet multiple times, and although he lost weight on it, found it very difficult and lost muscle on it.

Later on, he did a genetic analysis of his DNA, and found out that his DNA showed issues with ketogenic diets and suggested that a high starch diet would work best with him.  If he had this analysis available earlier, he could've avoided a lot of experimentation and just did the high starch potato diet.

Furthermore, his DNA suggested he needed specific nutrients more than most people, and after supplementing with them, found his energy levels improved signficantly.  

## Free Sampler

To give people an idea of how our system works, we made a free sampler app version of our program.  We ask you a bunch of questions, and based on your answers give you a set of recommendations and experiments you can run to see how your body works.  If the recommendations match how your body actually works, then you would lose weight far more easily than your previous attempts, and potentially solve a bunch of health issues too.

Since it's only a 10 minute survey although, there is a decent chance of not being a good match.  In our full program, we do a signficantly more comprihensive interview and adapt our recommendaitons as new data comes in.  We also analyze your DNA and bloodwork to give more targeted recommendations.  This improves the chance that we are correct and solve your weight loss issues.
