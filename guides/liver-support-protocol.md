## Overview
A specialized protocol designed to support and improve liver health alongside your weight loss journey.

If you are seeing this, it is because we have reason to believe your liver is under excessive stress either through your genetics, diet or environment.

The core source of what is overworking your liver can be hard to nail. In a modern environment, it can literally be so many things. But the good news is that fundamentally, almost everything after the point of stopping that source adding to your load is basically the same regardless of the source.

In addition to that, it is not unreasonable to say that every person in a modern environment has a stressed liver.

Literally, unless you live on a regenerative farm and you have a shredded six-pack, your liver will be under some stress. And so the principles that we can encapsulate below should carry forward into most of the walks of your life. 

## Key Principles
- Reduce liver burden/ Stop the source of toxicity
- Support/Speed up detoxification pathways
- Provide essential nutrients
- Eliminate harmful substances

## Protocol Phases
### Phase 1: Preparation (1 week)
- Eliminate Alcohol & Seed Oils
  Both of these require the ALDH pathway (the bodies' primary enzymatic detox pathway) to detox
- Remove processed foods
  The more processed the food, the more likely that it has some form of heavy metal toxicity. We see this time and time again when independent groups of concerned mothers decide to pay for their own lead or cadmium testing of baby food products. Additionally, processed foods will usually come with low-quality ingredients and lots of refined products, which themselves will likely slow down your ALDH pathway.
- Remove animal liver & liver oils (Cod liver oil, Pate)
  If you are extremely vitamin and mineral deficient, animal livers and animal liver oils can be a great way of getting nature's multivitamin. The truth is that most people actually struggle with hypervitaminosis of some form where they have toxic levels of vitamins and animal livers and liver oils come with very high loads of copper and vitamin A to name a few. 
- Reduce dairy (butter, eggs, milk etc)
  On the assumption that you might be struggling from a retinal processing challenge or from an overload of vitamin A, it's safe just to ramp down your dairy consumption during this protocol.
- Reduce the intake of large fish to twice a week.
  Large fish, including wild-caught salmon, sit at the top of a food chain. This means that heavy metals in the ocean accumulate up into everything they eat, such that if you're eating large doses of big fish at the top, you could be eating a lot of heavy metals. (Sardines and Mackerel, which species at the bottom of the food chain are safe to eat.)
- Reduce bright fruit & veg (Sweet potatoes, Carrots, Butternut squash, Pumpkin, Papaya, Tomato, Tangerine/Mandarin, Watermelon)
  Following on from the vitamin A concerns, the food items mentioned above are all super high in beta-carotene, which is the plant form of vitamin A. Your body converts it into vitamin A via another pathway, increasing the load that you then have to detoxify through your ALDH pathway. It makes sense to just reduce these as well.
- Maintain a good water intake
  Peeing regularly in the night is a sign that your kidneys are overloaded because your liver is spilling toxins over into them. We don't want to increase your water consumption such that you're ramping up how much you pee, but we do want to make sure you maintain a good water intake so that you are properly excreting any newly released toxins in your body. 

### Phase 2: Active Support (4-6 weeks)
#### Foods to Include
We've removed the majority of places where your toxins should be coming from.

At this point, we want to support your body's detox mechanisms through food and supplementation.

We both want to eat things that will speed up our ALDH pathway and we also want to increase the amount of soluble fiber that we are eating which will help to remove toxins from your body via your poop.

- High fiber vegetables (Cooked zucchini, Cooked broccoli, Cooked cabbage, Cooked Brussels sprouts)
- Leafy greens (not kale)
- Turmeric
- Green tea
- Pears
- Coconut water
- Jerusalem artichoke

#### Supplements to Consider
Most people should be able to go through this process without supplementing anything additional. I typically find that the most useful supplement is a soluble fibre supplement in the form of psyllium husk, but these other ones can also help you manage some of the detox symptoms. 
- Milk thistle
- NAC (N-Acetyl Cysteine)
- Lactoferrin
- Lactobacillus Rhamnosus Probiotic (this will radically speed up the production of ALDH enzymes)
- B-complex vitamins
- Glutathione support
- Soluble fiber (Psyllium Husk or Glucomannan)
- DHM (only if you have to drink or eat fried foods)
- Supplemental choline (GUIDE)

## Lifestyle Support
- Exercise that makes you sweat
  You don't need to start running marathons, but getting a little sweat and warming up your body will both speed up your detoxification and the sweat itself is a way to remove toxins. 
- Adequate sleep
  If you're constantly skimping on sleep, then your metabolism is likely heavily suppressed and won't have the energy to both deal with the additional stress that detoxing can cause and to turn on the detox mechanisms that you need. 
- Breath management
  Proper breathing techniques, whilst they sound esoteric, can both increase your metabolic rate and also the amount of carbon dioxide which you are excreting. Depending on the kind of toxicity, breathing out the metabolites of that toxin might actually be the primary way that you detoxify. Given that Patchwork focuses on increasing someone's energy and thus also letting them lose weight in a more comfortable way, we are huge fans of Butekyo breathing and you should follow our guide.[GUIDE] 
- Dry or Infrared Sauna (if available)
  You've probably heard the adage that you sweat out toxins, but fundamentally, your skin and sweating is actually the largest detox organ we have and you can speed this up by regularly using a dry or infrared sauna. The life hack is to get a used infrared sauna on Facebook Marketplace and to use it two or three times a week. If you feel like your detoxing too slowly and you physically can handle more, then you can follow our sauna detoxification guide here [GUIDE]to learn how to enhance this process.

## What to expect
I'm not going to lie to you, detoxing can have some really weird side effects. Fundamentally, you are going to be taking things from your liver and your existing fat stores and putting them into your bloodstream and then moving them back out of your bloodstream. One of the reasons that your body has stored them away is because when they're in your bloodstream they can cause damage.

Two things are going to happen:
- You're both going to start excreting these toxins and that can be in the form of increased mucus production in your mouth, your nose, your throat, in your eyes. Your pee can get cloudy, your poop can change color, your sweat can smell different, food and your environment can smell different to you.
- Secondly, by increasing the presence of toxins in your bloodstream, you will feel the side effects of that. You might end up with headaches, you can feel more lethargic, there can be GI distress etc. If this becomes too much for you, you have two options. You can either slow down the rate of detox or you can try to increase the way in which they are excreted.
