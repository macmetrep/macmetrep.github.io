Since you will be eating a lot of potatoes, this is the system we use to make a lot tasty peeled potatoes quickly that last for several days. 

## Get the right tools

We found these set of tools help us prepare our potatoes quickly without any microplastic contamination:

1. An oxo pro potato peeler
2. An instant pot
3. A metal steamer
4. A non-plastic scrub brush
5. A wooden cutting board 
6. A sealed container box to store them
7. A cutting knife

## Pick your potatoes well

We find places like sams club and costco give large 10lb bags of high quality large organic potatoes for $5, which saves you time and also tends to be the cheapest.  We only get one 10lb bag at a time per person, since if you get too much the potatoes start going green and require extra peeling work to get rid of the green flesh.  Grocery stores such as safeway tend to sell potatoes for far higher prices of lesser quality. 

In general, large potatoes are best since you get the most potato for the least amount of peeling work and tend to have less brown spots you need to gouge out.

## Place your tools in a line

We put our tools in a line to make processing them quick

Potato bag - instant pot with steamer inside - cutting board + tools - sink

## Start the process

1. Grab 2 or 3 potatoes from the bag, put them on the board
2. Scrub them quickly in the sink with water, put them back on the board
3. Peel them into the sink.  Make sure to peel off all the green flesh you see and any growths or black spots.
4. Chop them into large pieces (3 or 4, depending on size)
5. Throw them into the pot
6. Repeat 1 to 5 until the pot is full 
7. Put 1 cup of water into the instant pot
8. Start the instant pot to pressure cook for 10 minutes, and turn off keep warm
9. Throw the peels in the trash and wash your dishes while you wait for them to cook
10. Once done cooking, feel free to eat and then put the rest of the potatoes in the fridge.  Reheat them in the microwave or an air fryer.
