### Poaching Eggs in the Microwave

Eggs are a very good source of nutrition, but need to be cooked to eat.  We found poaching eggs in the microwave to be the best balance of time, dishes, simplicity and convienience.  It can be done almost anywhere, such as an office and does not taste like a "microwave cooked" food at all.

Instructions:

1. Get a microwave safe, non-plastic bowl, such as a ceramic or glass bowl.
2. Pour some water in the bowl.  Make sure to not fill it too much so water doesn't spill as you boil the water or move it around.
3. Put some salt in the bowl or a salty sauce such as soy sauce to prevent overboiling
4. Crack a few eggs into the bowl with water inside.  Fish out any shells you might crack into the bowl.  As you get good at this you won't get shells in the bowl very often.
5. Heat on high for 2.5 to 3.5 minutes, depending on the power of your microwave, the amount of water you put in and how well done you want the eggs.  As you do this multiple times you will learn the best amount of time you need to poach the eggs the way you like with the equipment you have. 
6. If the eggs are underdone feel free to put them in for another 30s
7. Fish them out of the bowl with a slotted spoon, or a normal fork and knife.  If you use normal sized utensils, then we suggest doing one egg at a time since they tend to break apart otherwise.
8. Rinse the bowl and throw it in the dishwasher!
9. Enjoy your freshly cooked eggs.
