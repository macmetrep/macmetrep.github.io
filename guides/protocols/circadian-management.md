## Overview

When people are in a dark room, they tend to get sleepy and low energy.  When people are outside in a bright sunny day, they tend to be more awake, alert and higher energy.  These are not contriversial statements for most people.   Fundamentally, we want to leverage these basic fact to help manage your energy levels, sleep quality and mood.

Almost all animals have something called a circadian clock or rythm.  This is a biological clock that syncronizes with envriomental cues to activate and deactative animals at certain times.  The less energetic an animal is when it doesn't need to be, the less resources it will need and thus the more likely it will survive.   To prevent drift of an animals circadian clock, and to provide adjustments as the environment changes throughout seasons, most animals have a clock that can change with changing enviromental cues.

This syncronization system is not fast.  It can take a while for our body's circadian clock to adjust to a new scheudle, which is where jet lag come from.

For humans, our circadian clock is mainly syncronized with light.  This is not just the light we can see with our vision although.  We have several light sensing proteins within our eyes and bodies that do not contribute to vision but do activate our circadian clock to certain cues.  One of these is called OPN5 and is more sensitive to spectrums of UV light than our blue light cones in our retina.  Another non vision light protein is called OPN4 and it is somewhat between our blue & green cones.   So even though we cannot see UV light, we have the OPN5 protein in our eyes that are sensitive to invisible UV light in our eyes that help waking us up and keeping us alert. 

Some people are more less or more sensitive to these environmental cues than others, and thus have a higher need for stronger environmental cues to keep their circadian clock in sync.  Or have a tendency for their circadian clock to drift, or not act very strongly due to various factors.  Links between ADHD and circadian rythm issues are being found for example.

Some people have found with stronger and properly timed circadian rythm stimulus, they fall asleep better, have more energy during day, reduce their hunger and even just lose weight from it alone without any other changes.

## List of experiments

The author does all of these things, and he has found them to be helpful for his energy levels, sleep quality and mood.

### 10 minute morning wake up walk or light exposure

After you wake up and do your general first parts of your morning routine, go outside and get some sunlight visible in your eyes.  Preferably in the actual outdoors if weather permits.  If not then at least go to the sunniest part of your home and look outside for a few minutes, although real unfiltered sunlight is best since windows tend to filter out some UV and infrared light that our bodies use as a day time stimulus.  

The author tends to do a 10 minute walk in the morning after he wakes up and goes to the bathroom.  Another person we know wakes up, stays in bed with their morning coffee and then goes sits outside for 10 minutes in the outdoors. 

We have found this wakes us up in the morning, makes us more sleepy in the evening and sleep better at night.

### Avoid blue light in the evening, keep your house dim at night

This one is a harder one, but there are things you can do to reduce the amount of blue light in your house at night time.  Adopt them as they fit into your life.  You can also wear blue light blocking glasses in the last couple hours before bed if these changes would be too much.

* Replace your light bulbs with 2700K warm light bulbs
* Get smart bulbs that can shift their color temperature to warmer colors at night time, and cooler colors such as 5600K during the day
* Get dimmable light bulbs you can turn down at night time 
* Turn on night shift (iOS & macOS), night light (Windows), or night mode (Android) during night time on your computing devices, and turn them off during the day.
* Avoid watching HDR content on your TV or computer during the night, since it can simulate daytime outdoors 

### Brighten up your indoor environment during the day

Conversely, you also need a bright day time stimulus with light that is the closest to daylight as possible during the day to keep your circadian clock in sync and to wake you up.  This can mean buying a lot of high brightness 5600K light bulbs for use during the daytime in your home office, buying intense 200W movie lights to brigten up your home office, or ideally moving your working space to a very sunny location.  "Blue light" light bulbs are you friend in this case. 

### Spend more time outdoors when it's sunny

It's hard to beat the sun, and it's free.  If you can be outdoors more in general, do it. One example is reading a book outside during the day vs. doing it inside if it's all the same to you either way.  Make your breaks be outside vs. staying inside.  This is all very weather dependent.

## Risky experiments

**⚠️ WARNING:** These experiments are just ideas, and are put here for entertainment purposes.  They have risks and could be harmful to your health or injure you.

### Add a blacklight to your working room

Since we have OPN5 proteins in our body that detect UV light from the sun and elsewhere to help keep our circadian clock in sync, we can also use UV light to help keep our circadian clock in sync.  A cheap $15, 30W 400nm violet "black light" can be used for this purose to activate our OPN5 protein and make us more alert.  UV light like this has a risk of giving you sunburns, tanning your skin or eye burns, but we think it's unlikely and dependent on the intensity of the light.

### Get a tanning booth subscription

Similarly, since our body uses UV light to syncronize our circadian clock, going to a tanning booth mid day can be a useful way to get circadian rythm stimulus at the right time, especially if it's cold, dark or difficult to get sun exposure.

### Use a vitamin D lamp

UVB is vital in naturally making vitamin D in our body.  A UVB vitamin D lamp such as a sperti used with eye protection can help syncronize your circadian clock better, especially if done mid day.
