## Overview
A specialized dietary approach focused on healing and supporting optimal gut function while promoting healthy weight management.

There are two parts of gut repair:
- Making sure that we can heal the lining of your gut
- Trying to enhance the microbial diversity of your gut.

Many doctors who actually underwent their training decades ago simply say the microbiome is too complex and we don't know enough about it. But modern science has shown that there are very specific key strains of bacteria that we need to survive beyond how we evolved, known as commensal organisms.

The best way to determine whether you have the adequate commensals is to do a microbiome gut test with a stool sample. Even without, there's really no downside to trying the gut repair protocol.

## Key Principles
- Remove inflammatory foods
- Replace with gut-healing foods
- Reinoculate with beneficial bacteria
- Repair gut lining
- Rebalance lifestyle factors

## Phase 1: Remove (2-4 weeks)
Whilst we would normally prescribe that you rip the band-aid off and remove all of these triggers at once, many people's lives and logistics are such that they need to do it slowly over a 2-4 week period.

Start with one move to the list, remove the next thing.

If you're feeling some level of resolution or improvementof your symptoms, definitely stick to the whole protocol and don't give up too early.

When it comes to inflammation, each one of these things will exacerbate the next one. So by removing one, you might start feeling better, but really we want to remove all of them to start with.

- Eliminate common triggers:
  - Gluten
  
  This is going to be pretty much every baked or grain-based food. If you still want to eat lots of carbohydrates, you can replace it with potatoes or rice.
  It's easy to be tempted to then replace bread with gluten-free bread, but you'll see further down the list, processed foods also need to be removed. So don't replace stuff with gluten-free alternatives that come in a packet. 
  - Dairy
  
  Dairy products can be inflammatory for many reasons for many people and are removed entirely in this protocol. That's Milk, Cheese, Yogurt, Butter and Ice Cream. 
  - Processed foods/Seed Oils
  
  Many people with an inflamed gut have seemingly resolved their issues simply by removing seed oils (usually hidden in the form of sauces on salads) from their diet.  
  
  Seed oils are also known as vegetable oils.  Some are canola, soy, corn, sunflower, safflower, and peanut.   Coconut oil is not a seed oil, along with animal fats.  Because of how chickens and pigs are fed today, they chicken and pork fat are fairly equivalent to seed oils.  Avocado oil & olive oil are also not "seed oils", but are often adulterated with seed oils to not be a reliable source of seed oil free fat.

  Seed oils are a primary driver of colon cancer and other gut dysbiosis issues. We won't get into it here, but it has also been shown that seed oils directly kill microbiome species, so we want to remove all processed foods and seed oils from your diet. If life makes this basically impossible, the absolute top thing to remove is fried foods and foods fried in seed oils. 
  - Sugar
  
  For many, sugar is actually totally benign. Refined sugar or processed sugar is usually the issue, but in the context of what we're doing here, we want to try and remove all sugar and all added sugar products from your diet.
  - Alcohol
  
  Whilst alcohol can be a hormetic stressor, there is absolutely no net benefit to your gut by consuming it, and so we do not want to drink any alcohol on this protocol. 

## Phase 2: Replace (4-8 weeks)
### Healing Foods
Depending on how inflamed or how far gone your gut is, you either need to incorporate some of these healing foods or base your entire diet around these healing foods. We'll leave that determination up to you. 
- Bone broth

  Bone broth is primarily the best gut wall healing food that we know of. There are plenty of very fancy, expensive regenerative brands for bone broth in the supermarket. If you want to go budget, try and get chicken bone broth as chicken bones are less likely to accumulate heavy metals compared to beef.  Bones don't have fat, so you don't need to worry about chicken fat causing issues since the bones do not have them.
  
- Fermented foods

  Kimchi, sauerkraut and natto are all examples of fermented foods developed by ancient societies that are available today. The best way we've seen to incorporate them is to just take a scoop of sauerkraut and put it into whatever salad you're eating. Note that kimchi is spicy and may also upset your stomach. 
- Prebiotic-rich foods

  You've probably heard the term probiotic, and less likely to have had the term prebiotic. Prebiotics are the foods that the bacteria in your microbiome like to eat. So you can choose to eat foods that your gut microbiome will like and that will increase their potential to grow in a healthy way. Fundamentally, the best prebiotics are resistant starch and insoluble fiber.

These are found abundantly in Garlic, Onions, Leeks, Asparagus, Jerusalem artichokes (sunchokes), Chicory root, Unripe Bananas, Apple Skins, Kiwi fruit (skin on)

- L-glutamine rich foods

  L-glutamine is essential for maintaining and repairing the intestinal barrier.

  Animal foods rich in L-glutamine:
  - Beef, especially ribeye and skirt steak
  - Fish, such as wild coho salmon
  - Eggs
 
  Plant foods rich in L-glutamine:
  - Legumes: beans (may inflame stomach), lentils, and peas
  - Nuts and seeds: almonds, cashews, pumpkin seeds, and sunflower seeds
  - Whole grains: brown rice, oats, and quinoa
  
- Zinc-rich foods

  Zinc is also essential for maintaining and repairing your intestinal barrier.

  Oysters have the highest concentration of bioavailable zinc in the food, but other great sources include Beef, Crab, Lobster and Cheese. 

### Supplements to Consider
- Quality probiotics

  Taking broad-spectrum probiotics endlessly is not something we recommend, but if you have data showing that your microbiome diversity is low, taking a probiotic for a 30-90 day course can be great.
  
- L-glutamine

  L-Glutamine is a very simple and affordable supplement you can buy on Amazon. We are happy with the NutriCost brand.

  It's important to note that while L-glutamine supplementation is generally considered safe, it may cause side effects like constipation, nausea, and headaches in some individuals. People with liver disease or bipolar disorder should avoid high doses of L-glutamine supplements.
  
- Zinc carnosine

  Zinc carnosine is a chelated compound consisting of zinc and L-carnosine bound together which promotes mucosal integrity in the gastrointestinal tract and supports gut repair.

  Side effects are extremely rare and only occur in long-term usage so make sure you don't take more than 50mg a day and for longer than 90 days.  If you are not eating any copper rich foods, such as liver, then gently supplementing with 1mg of copper per 15mg of zinc is a good idea.  Zinc and copper conflict with each other, so you need to space out your copper supplementation from your zinc supplementation by eating them at separate meals.
  
- Digestive enzymes
  
  Digestive enzymes can potentially support gut repair in improved nutrient absorption, reduced digestive stress and support for gut microbiome, but they should be considered last and will only work if you have removed the food items highlighted above.

## Phase 3: Maintenance
- We've removed inflammatory foods, then spent weeks adding foods that will repair your gut lining and enhance your microbiome. The final step is to move more towards maintaining a healthy gut. The first step in this is to slowly reintroduce some of the foods we've moved. Critically, you want to reintroduce foods one-by-one and independently of each other, and then you want to monitor the reactions you have to those foods. If you have a bad reaction over a week that you've introduced a certain food, say like gluten, then it looks like in the long term you need to avoid that food.

We don't advise that anybody adds back seed oils.

- Through this process of elimination, repair, and then adding things back, you should be able to get yourself into a pretty good rhythm of maintaining beneficial habits and dietary choices.

## Lifestyle Factors
There are several lifestyle factors that can both diminish the strength of your gut lining and also reshape your microbiome.
- Stress management

  Stress and the hormonal response to stress will directly affect the integrity of your gut lining and the shape of your microbiome. If you feel that you are in a particularly stressful state or environment, you want to fix that and also find ways to manage that through journaling or breath work. 
- Adequate sleep

If you are chronically under-slept, that will directly damage your metabolism and also the strength of your gut lining. Additionally, your microbiome actually reacts to your circadian rhythm. So you want to make sure that you've got your waking and sleeping times in order. 
- Gentle exercise

Exercise can both help and hinder your gut repair process. A little known fact is that endurance exercise actually weakens the gut lining and can damage your microbiome. We find that in endurance athletes specifically, they have high levels of circulating endotoxin. So, gentle exercise like increasing the amount you walk will be fantastic, but don't be doing endurance events on a bike.

Strength training does not have the same effect on the gut lining as endurance exercise, so please continue to do strength training if you do it.

- Proper meal timing

Many of the systems involved in digestion and microbiome health follow both a habitual pattern and a circadian pattern, which will line up with your meal timing. So you want to make sure you're eating meals at appropriate times and not right before you go to bed. 

## Customization

This is a generic gut repair protocol.  For some people some parts of this might not work well for them and they will need custom modifications.  We can help you with that if you find this doesn't work well for you, so please reach out to us.
