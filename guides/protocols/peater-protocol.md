     * historically we used to take a lot more thyroid by accident
     * drink the skim milk
     * bone broth / gelatin, high glycine to methionine ratio
     * like sugar but don't like HFCS because it's polluted
     * hate keto
     * love asprin
     * solve insulin resistane with a high sugar diet (mike fave / paul salidino talk)
     * nobody ingests fructose by itself, they work symbiotically, iso-caloric and isolated
 * ray peat : mechanisitic, not a lot of clinical (downward spirial of ???)
     * espeically for women who really get themelseves in a hole
     * only fat they talk about is coconut oil because it's prometabolic (coconut oil pigs)
     * coconut oil to straight ketone bodies with liver issues doesn't work well
