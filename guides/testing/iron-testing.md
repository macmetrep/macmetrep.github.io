We see hints of potential iron overload in your question results.  We suggest getting tested for Ferritin, and if you are over 100, to do blood dontations until it's below that number.  If you don't want to get tested, doing frequent blood donations is good for your health and can help prevent this issue either way, and is a good way to help others on top of that.  Your blood donation center will tell you how often you can donate and how safely you can do it.  They will need to be blood donations, plasma donations do not work for this.
