We see hints of potential neurodiversity or sensory sensitivity in your question results.  We suggest getting tested for potential neurodiveristy or sensory sensitivities.  People with undiagnosed neurodiversity conditions can often get exausted with living day to day, causing increased demands for food to help them process the increased mental demands and stress on their minds, which can often cause have a difficult time with losing weight.  By learning about their neurodiveristy, they can often decrease this mental stress or get treatments that help them and often end up having a easier time losing weight and increased energy levels. 

If you do have a neurodiveristy condition, then this can potentially revolutionize your life.   If you don't, then at least you know for sure and can move on with your life. 

We don't know if you have a neurodiveristy condition, cannot diagnose you, are not medical professionals / health care proviers and cannot give you a treament plan for it.  We can only suggest that you get tested for it and work with compitent health care providers to help you with it if diagnosed.
