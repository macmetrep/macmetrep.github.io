## Match Reasons
One core principle of our system is matching your diet to what works best for your body.  One major part of this is which foods do you extract the most energy from in a usable form for the rest of your body.  Based on your answers, we have determined that your body probably works best with starch as a primary source of energy.

You have also shown a high level of interest in achieving results quickly and are willing to modify your diet to a large degree to achieve this.  If you find these recommendations too extreme, you can try the more flexible [High Starch Diet](/guides/high-starch-diet.html) instead.

## Stages
* Potato Only Experiment (1-2 weeks):  Eat only potatoes, along with fat free low calorie sauces, such as soy sauce, siracha, vinegar, pepper and so on.  The goal here is to isolate variables and see how your body responds to a very high starch diet without anything else potentially interfering with the results.
* Mostly Potato Diet (1-3 months):  If the intial experiment shows good results, we can move to a more flexible diet.   Potatoes will remain your primary source of energy, but we add other foods and supplements to fill out micronutritional needs to make it sustainable.

## Later Stages Available in Patchwork Premium
* Expanding your diet to include other sources of starch and other foods to increase variety.
* Finding out your end state 'forever diet' that you can stick to for the rest of your life.
