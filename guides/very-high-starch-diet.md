# Intro

## Match Reasons
One core principle of our system is matching your diet to what works best for your body.  One major part of this is which foods do you extract the most energy from in a usable form for the rest of your body.  Based on your answers, we have determined that your body probably works best with starch as a primary source of energy in it's current state.

You have also shown a high level of interest in achieving results quickly and are willing to modify your diet to a large degree to achieve this.  If you find these recommendations too extreme, you can try the more flexible [High Starch Diet](/high-starch-diet.html) instead.

## Stages
* Potato Only Experiment (1-2 weeks):  Eat only potatoes, along with fat free low calorie sauces, such as soy sauce, siracha, vinegar, pepper and so on.  The goal here is to isolate variables and see how your body responds to a very high starch diet without anything else potentially interfering with the results.
* Mostly Potato Diet (1-3 months):  If the intial experiment shows good results, we can move to a more flexible diet.   Potatoes will remain your primary source of energy, but we add other foods and supplements to fill out micronutritional needs to make it sustainable.

## Later Stages Available in Patchwork Premium
* Expanding your diet to include other sources of starch and other foods to increase variety.
* Finding out your end state 'forever diet' that you can stick to for the rest of your life.

# Potato Only Experiment

The goal here is to see if your body responds well to eating a diet of mostly starch.  Potatoes are ideal for this because they contain a lot of nutrition on their own and several other properties that make them an ideal test of how your metabolism responds to a starch heavy diet. 

The diet is pretty simple, just eat potatoes (not sweet potatoes) of any kind you like and as much as you want.  You can eat it with various sauces that are fat free and low calorie, such as soy sauce, various hot sauces, maggi sauce, spices, salt, vinegar and so on.  You can also cook them any way you want.   You cannot have it with fat although, it isn't the french fry diet after all.   

Some people are sensitive to eating a large amount of potato skin, so we suggest peeling all of your potatoes.

This diet causes you to eat 90% of your calories from carbs.

## Experiment Tips

* Peel all of your potatoes, gouging out brown spots and growth spots under the peel, and peeling anything that looks green in the flesh. The large amounts of solanine that are in the skin and green parts of the potatoes make people feel sick as it builds up in your body. The oxo pro swivel peeler is fairly popular with potato dieters and much nicer to work with vs. other cheap peelers.
* Getting the largest potatoes you can find reduces your labor in preparing the potatoes. You get more potato flesh in volume but less potato surface to peel.
* Russet potatoes tend to be the ones that people don't get sick of. Yellow potatoes, as tasty as they are 
* Storing your potatoes in a dark, dry bag reduces the amount of solanine buildup and keeps them fresher longer.
* Cook using an air fryer or steaming in an instant pot or a general steamer. Boiling or microwaving the potatoes makes them taste far worse, and reduces their nutrition.

## Goal

While you do this, you should track your weight and how you feel on the diet in a note somewhere.   If you feel fairly good on the diet, don't feel hungry, are losing weight and have other generally positive results, then that is a good indicator that starch is a good match for you.

We only want to do this for a week or two to see how you respond.  If you respond well, then we can expand to a "mostly potato" diet that includes other foods to round out your micronutrition and improve taste.

If the diet doesn't agree with you, even after peeling your potatoes, using russet potatoes and cooking them in an air fryer, baking or steaming, then it is probably not a match for you and this tells us that starch is probably not your macronutrient of choice. 

# Mostly Potato Diet

Congrats, we have figured out your macronutrient of choice!  Now we can expand the diet further to make sure you get enough micronutrients in the long term as you lose weight using starch.  We basically want to add foods to make the diet balanced, while keeping as much of your calories coming from potatoes.    

One example addition is:

1. ü•ö 3 eggs, poached in the microwave with runny yolks to have more nutrition from runny vs. hard yolks. (choline and many other micronutrients, 250 cal)
2. ü´ê 100-120g of frozen acai berry + 10-15g of honey or maple syrup (vitamin E + minerals and others) (120 cal)
3. ü•ï 1 large carrot (vitamin A, 50 cal)
4. üçô Nori seaweed sheets (for iodine + spice) (2 cal)
5. üç´ 20g of 80% dark chocolate
6. üíä Supplements: Methylfolate, Zinc (25mg), selenium (100mg), and a vitamin K MK-7 supplement.  Vitamin D is another supplement, but you also can get that from sun exposure. 

If any of the above foods do not agree with you, or are not easily available, you can use an app like [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/) to calculate what would cover your micronutritional needs, or potentially subsitute it with a supplement.  Make sure to track all of the food you eat in a day, including the potatoes to know how much micronutrition you need. 

### Poaching Eggs in the Microwave

Eggs are a very good source of nutrition, but need to be cooked to eat.  We found poaching eggs in the microwave to be the best balance of time, dishes, simplicity and convienience.  It can be done almost anywhere, such as an office and does not taste like a "microwave cooked" food at all.

Instructions:

1. Get a microwave safe, non-plastic bowl, such as a ceramic or glass bowl.
2. Pour some water in the bowl.  Make sure to not fill it too much so water doesn't spill as you boil the water or move it around.
3. Put some salt in the bowl or a salty sauce such as soy sauce to prevent overboiling
4. Crack a few eggs into the bowl with water inside.  Fish out any shells you might crack into the bowl.  As you get good at this you won't get shells in the bowl very often.
5. Heat on high for 2.5 to 3.5 minutes, depending on the power of your microwave, the amount of water you put in and how well done you want the eggs.  As you do this multiple times you will learn the best amount of time you need to poach the eggs the way you like with the equipment you have. 
6. If the eggs are underdone feel free to put them in for another 30s
7. Fish them out of the bowl with a slotted spoon, or a normal fork and knife.  If you use normal sized utensils, then we suggest doing one egg at a time since they tend to break apart otherwise.
8. Rinse the bowl and throw it in the dishwasher!
9. Enjoy your freshly cooked eggs.
